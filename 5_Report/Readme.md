# ATM_Management_System Using C

## Introduction
![Intruduction](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/07/17/22/06/atm-1524870__480.jpg)
 -A ATM In C is based on a concept of managing an account personally. From this ATM System C Mini Project, the user can check total balance, Deposit Amount and Withdraw Amounts easily as it is not time-consuming. 
 This program for using ATM machine is built on the concept of handling an account individually.
It can be defined as actually simple code structure of ATM transaction process to be understood by a user. For implementing this project, we may have to use function but in the meantime for easy coding, we may have to switch cause statement.
From this ATM program in C, we can even use the mini-program for checking the total balance, depositing the amount, and withdrawing the amount from the account definitely since it is not time overwhelming.

 ## Research

An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic banking outlet that allows customers to complete basic transactions without the aid of a branch representative or teller. Anyone with a credit card or debit card can access cash at most ATMs.
ATMs are convenient, allowing consumers to perform quick self-service transactions such as deposits, cash withdrawals, bill payments, and transfers between accounts. Fees are commonly charged for cash withdrawals by the bank where the account is located, by the operator of the ATM, or by both. Some or all of these fees can be avoided by using an ATM operated directly by the bank that holds the account.


ATMs are known in different parts of the world as automated bank machines (ABM) or cash machines.





## Defining Our System
![Defining Our System](https://images.slideplayer.com/25/7790368/slides/slide_3.jpg)

  - Although the design of each ATM is different, they all contain the same basic parts:
  - Card reader: This part reads the chip on the front of the card or the magnetic stripe on the back of the card. 
  - Keypad: The keypad is used by the customer to input information, including personal identification number (PIN), the type of transaction required, and the amount of the transaction.
  - Cash dispenser: Bills are dispensed through a slot in the machine, which is connected to a safe at the bottom of the machine.

  - Printer: If required, consumers can request receipts that are printed here. The receipt records the type of transaction, the amount, and the account balance.
  - Screen: The ATM issues prompts that guide the consumer through the process of executing the transaction. Information is also transmitted on the screen, such as account information and balances.
